            <p>In modern workplaces Slack is the primary hub for real‑time collaboration.<br>
            Threads, in particular, often become the <strong>de facto source of truth</strong> for decisions, troubleshooting steps, and project details.<br>
            However, not every thread deserves to be treated as a permanent reference.<br>
            The participants of a thread are usually the best judges of its lasting value—they can intuit whether the discussion should be kept for future queries or discarded as transient chatter.</p>

            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Signal vs. noise:</strong> Valuable insights are buried among countless routine conversations.</li>
                <li><strong>Retrieval overhead:</strong> Finding the right thread later can require scrolling through long histories.</li>
                <li><strong>Knowledge decay:</strong> Threads evolve; without a systematic way to capture updates, important information is lost.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Our Solution: Slack Thread Base (SLB)</h2>
            <p>To help teams <strong>capture, curate, and reuse</strong> the most useful Slack threads, we built <strong>Slack Thread Base (SLB)</strong>—a lightweight Slack app that turns selected conversations into a searchable knowledge base.</p>

        <section class="why-it-works">
            <h2>Why SLB Works</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Selective Preservation</strong> – Users decide which threads merit preservation, ensuring only high‑quality knowledge is stored.</li>
                <li><strong>Instant Summaries</strong> – Summaries cut down on time spent re‑reading lengthy discussions.</li>
                <li><strong>Context‑Rich Answers</strong> – Queries are answered with direct references, so users can always verify the source.</li>
                <li><strong>Ongoing Maintenance</strong> – Updated threads can be refreshed, and obsolete entries can be removed, preventing knowledge rot.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>By integrating SLB into your Slack workspace, you transform ad‑hoc conversations into a <strong>living, searchable knowledge base</strong> that empowers every team member to find reliable answers fast, without sifting through endless chat history.</p>
